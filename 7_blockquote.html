      <p>That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the
        incredible uptake of Bootstrap. I use it in all the server software
        I'm working on. And it shows through in the templating language I'm
        developing, so everyone who uses it will find it's "just there" and
        works, any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do,
        no libraries to include. It's as if it were part of the hardware.
        Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.</p>
